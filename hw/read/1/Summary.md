####**ii. Keywords**

**ii1. Software Forums** 
These are webpages that consist of Question-Answer type conversations for users (typically developers) and serve as platforms where they can discuss the issues faced and go about suggesting ways on how to go about resolving them. These threads can be of extreme value in content when accurately searched for the necessary tags.

**ii2. Normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG)**
This metric is used to rank quality by measuring the performance of a recommendation system based on the graded relevance of the entities used. It ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, with 1.0 representing the ideal ranking. It is commonly used in information retrieval tools and to evaluate the performance of web search engines.

**ii3. Positive/Negative Feedback**
The answers posted on the thread in a web forum can be classified as positive, negative or junk based on the content, in order to efficiently filter the number of posts and extract only the relevant data. Positive feedback answers are those which resolve or provide solutions to the question being asked, negative feedback are those posts which indicate that the proposed solution fails and that the issue is yet to be resolved.

**ii4. Feature Vector**
Before processing large amounts of text data, they are usually converted into feature vectors, which are simplified words obtained from the original text. These processed words hold the main content and can be used for classification purposes. Examples of processes, which aid in producing feature vectors, are stop word removal (which removes non-descriptive words such as prepositions and pronouns) and stemming (extracting affixes).
